# money_where_your_mouth_is
DBC Hack-a-thon Project: Tasked with using NYC open api resources to create a command line app in an afternoon. Money Where Your Mouth Is is the result of 4 hours of collaboration including ideation, creation and presentation between 4 students. The app fills a much needed gap in business.  The app allows the user to search for women and minority-run businesses by zipcode. Results are published on the command line.
